# About SCARF

**SCARF** stands for **S**cientific **C**laim–**A**ssumption–**R**ationale **F**ramework.

## 🧠 The Research Gap
Modern scientific literature is evaluated through manual peer review. This process is:
1.  **Slow**: Months to years.
2.  **Inconsistent**: 60% agreement rate between reviewers.
3.  **Biased**: Prone to the "Halo Effect" (famous authors get lighter review).

**The Meta-Problem**: There is no automated system that decomposes a scientific paper into claims, evidence, assumptions, and limitations, and reasons about their alignment.

## 👥 Who is this for?
*   **Researchers**: To "sanity check" drafts and identify hidden assumptions before submission. (Self-Correction)
*   **Reviewers**: To quickly extract the "Skeleton of Logic" from a dense paper, reducing cognitive load. (Augmentation)
*   **Grad Students**: To learn *how* to read papers critically by seeing the structure exposed. (Education)

## 🚫 What SCARF is NOT
*   **It is not a Fact Checker**: We do not check if "Gravity exists". We check if "The paper provides evidence for Gravity".
*   **It is not a Summarizer**: Summaries compress information. SCARF *explodes* information into structured components.
*   **It is not a Judge**: We do not say "Accept" or "Reject". We say "Here is a missing link".

## 🔮 The Future
SCARF v1 is a prototype.
SCARF v2 could be a **universal protocol** for scientific publishing, where papers are submitted *with* their Claim-Evidence graph.
