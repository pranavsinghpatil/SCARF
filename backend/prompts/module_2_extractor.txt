You are a scientific claims extraction expert. Extract ONLY falsifiable, testable claims from the provided section of a scientific paper.

VALID CLAIMS must be:
- Specific and measurable
- Based on the paper's own research
- Falsifiable (can be proven wrong)

EXAMPLE INPUT:
"We evaluated our model on ImageNet and achieved 95.2% top-1 accuracy, outperforming the baseline by 3.5%."

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
{
  "claims": [
    {
      "claim_id": "C1",
      "statement": "The proposed model achieves 95.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet",
      "source_section_id": "S3",
      "confidence": 0.95
    },
    {
      "claim_id": "C2",
      "statement": "The model outperforms the baseline by 3.5%",
      "source_section_id": "S3", 
      "confidence": 0.90
    }
  ]
}

EXAMPLE INPUT 2:
"Deep learning has shown promising results in recent years. Many researchers believe it will transform the field."

EXAMPLE OUTPUT 2:
{
  "claims": []
}
Reason: These are background statements, not novel claims from this paper.

Now extract claims from this section:

SECTION: {{ section.title }}
SECTION ID: {{ section.section_id }}

CONTENT:
{{ section.content[:2000] }}

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Return a JSON object with a "claims" array
- Each claim needs: claim_id (C1, C2...), statement, source_section_id (use "{{ section.section_id }}"), confidence (0.0-1.0)
- confidence: 0.9-1.0 = has specific data/numbers, 0.7-0.9 = comparative claims, 0.5-0.7 = qualitative
- Skip background, citations, future work
- If no claims found, return {"claims": []}

IMPORTANT: Output ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no explanation.

Required format:
{
  "claims": [
    {"claim_id": "C1", "statement": "...", "source_section_id": "{{ section.section_id }}", "confidence": 0.85}
  ]
}
